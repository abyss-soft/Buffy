# Buffy
My job in 2002 years

Once my friend (the administrator in the game club) suggested that, they say, no one can write a simple program that would remove garbage from temporary directories and at the same time would not take up memory. That's how the first version of the program 'Buffy' appeared. Since then, a lot of time has passed, but the program continued to be used until Windows2000 / XP replaced Windows9x. The first version of the program no longer cope with its duties, so I had to completely rewrite the entire program again, so this version appeared.
